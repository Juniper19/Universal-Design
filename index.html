          Hi! My name is Rylee. I'm a Creative Technology and Design student with a niche passion 
          for writing game design video essays on YouTube, and making games. Most of my creative life revolves around exploring why games feel the way they do: 
          what makes a mechanic satisfying, what makes a story land emotionally, and how design choices impact the player on a deeper level. While I have moderate experience in web
          development, most of my experience lies within games, and that's where I hope to introduce accessibility practices.
          Everyone deserves to be able to play games and not be held back by things out of their control!
          <br><br>
          In addition to that, I am currently learning chess, getting back into reading, and hiking. Logic puzzles are very fun to me and 
          in a way, they're found all in programming, whether it's web or backend game development. I'm excited to keep learning about accessibility practices
          in and out of this class to make the most open experiences possible!
