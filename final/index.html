      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to this exploration of Universal Design for the web. This site was created as a learning project to demonstrate accessible web practices while teaching the fundamentals of building for everyone. There are three pages to explore that will detail the what, how and why of Universal Design. The web is constantly evolving, and so are our approaches to making it work for more people. This project represents a snapshot of that ongoing conversation about who gets to participate online and how we can remove the barriers that keep people out.</p>

      <h2>About this project</h2>
      <p>This site itself is an exercise in Universal Design. It uses semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where appropriate, proper heading hierarchy, keyboard-accessible navigation, and sufficient color contrast throughout. The goal is to show that accessible design doesn't mean boring design, it means thoughtful design!</p>
