    <h1>Why Universal Design?</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Designing for everyone</h2>
      <p>The internet was never made for one "type" of person. Today's web is shaped by millions of users with their own lived experiences, devices,
         langauges and physical abilities. Some people use screen readers, some use keyboard-only navigation, some on low-contrast monitors or on tiny phones
         with cracked screens. Millions of people, both able bodied and not, utilize accessibility features on the web every single day. Whether it's dark mode or increasing
         the size of text, accessibility helps everybody while also challenging the idea that there is a "default" user of the Internet.

      <h2>The reality...</h2>
      <p>The World Health Organization estimates that 1.3 billion people around the world experience significant disability, which represents about 16% of the world's population. That's 1 in 6 people.</p>

      <p>And the thing is, <strong>anyone can become disabled at any time.</strong> Any injury, whether temporary or permanent, can hinder anyone's ability to use the Internet.
         A broken wrist, a migraine, bright sunlight washing out a phone screen, a loud room, etc. all affect how we interact with the web, and make applications of Universal Design
         more important than ever.

      <h2>Corporate incentive</h2>
      <p>While the ethics of pursuing Universal Design in the name of corporate profit are questionable, it is an extremely relevant argument in the case of online accessibility nonetheless.
         A website that is easier and more intuitive to use, clearer to navigate and more consistent across devices simply performs better and retains more users. Users trust these interfaces more 
         and do not get as frustrated by them. In the attention-economy we currently find ourselves in, usability is a competitive advantage. By working to get rid of the friction points in a site that would
         otherwise lose users, companies are able to create better connections with their audience, and ultimately find themselves more successful in their profits, while also ensuring that truly <i>everyone</i> can access
         their websites. It's a win win.

      <h2>The next step in history</h2>
      <p>The web has only advanced as far as developers and designers have pushed for better practices. In the early 2000s, CSS Zen Garden proved that
        accessibility and aesthetics can coexist. Alongside it, emerging Web Standards introduced semantic markup and cleaner code so the web could be more stable,
        interoperable, and easier to access. Later, HTML5 gave structure to content with specific markup elements. Each of these changes have made the web more usable, and started
        as a community driven effort.<strong> Universal design is simply the next wave of these movements, and the one that will arguably effect the greatest number of people.</strong>

      <h2>Ethical technology, and the future that awaits</h2>
      <p>Universal Design is not just a design philosophy, but an ethical stance and social movement in and of itself. It shifts our line of thinking from "does this work for me?" to "does this work for 
        people who interact with this world differently than I do?". This reframing pushes designers to consider the real impact of their choices and opens up the door for greater empathy to take root in our
        increasingly isolated society. By developing and creating with Universal Design in mind, we are also committing to a more equitable digital space where people are not left out simply because their bodies, minds,
        resources or environments don't match our own. Universal Design is ultimately the framework that allows for empathy to take root in more technology going forward.
        
        
        <br><br>It really is the question of what kind of future we want to build, especially
        as Gen-Z, and what kind of web we will inherit when we are older and no longer as able-bodied as we are now. The choices we make today will decide whether that future includes us, or leaves us behind.
