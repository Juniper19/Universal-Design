      <h2>Definition of Universal Design</h2>
      <p>Universal Design refers to the design of products, environments and services that are usable by all people to the widest extent possible. It aims to
        be inclusive from the start so that individuals do not need specialized or custom designs to access the same media others can freely experience. The practices
        of Universal Design manifest through seven core principles, which are generally informed by Norman's design vocabulary, and semantic HTML practices. All of these are explained below.

      <h2>The Seven Principles of Universal Design</h2>
      <p>These principles are the core qualities that make online interfaces usable by the widest range of people possible. They act as a framework
        for evaluating whether a design is intuitive and inclusive across different contexts and user abilities.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Equitable Use</h3>
      <p>The design is useful and marketable to people with disabilities.</p>

      <h3>2. Flexibility in Use</h3>
      <p>The design accomodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</p>

      <h3>3. Simple & Intuitive</h3>
      <p>Use of the design is easy to understand regardless of user experience, langauge or concentration.</p>

      <h3>4. Perceptible Information</h3>
      <p>Design communicates necessary information effectively regardless of ambience or sensory abilities.</p>

      <h3>5. Tolerance for Error</h3>
      <p>The design minimizes hazards or consequences of accidents or unintended actions.</p>

      <h3>6. Low Physical Effort</h3>
      <p>The design can be used effectively and comfortably with a minimum of fatigue.</p>

      <h3>7. Size & Space for Approach</h3>
      <p>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation and use regardless of user body or mobility.</p>

      <h2>Norman's Design Vocabulary</h2>

      <h3>1. Affordances</h3>
      <p>The characteristics or properties of an object that suggest how it can be used.</p>

      <h3>2. Signifiers</h3>
      <p>Perceptible cues that designers include in interfaces so users can easily discover what to do.</p>

      <h3>3. Constraints</h3>
      <p>Constraints involve limiting the range of interaction possibilities to simplify the user experience, and guide them to the appropriate actions.</p>

      <h3>4. Feedback</h3>
      <p>This is the principle of making it clear to the user what the response is to their actions.</p>

      <h3>5. Mapping</h3>
      <p>This is about having clear correlation between controls and their effect.</p>

      <h3>6. Conceptual Models</h3>
      <p>Mental stimulations of devices that enable users to judge the means of operation and possible uses.</p>

      <h2>Web Standards & Semantic HTML </h2>
      <p>Semantic HTML is the practice of using HTML elements that describe the meaning and role of the content as opposed to solely how it looks on screen. Instead of putting everything
        into broad div tags, there are elemenets like 'header', 'nav' and 'button' that communicate what each part of a page actually is. This gives the browser (and assistive technology!) a clear
        map of the page's structure. For screen readers and keyboard navigation, semantic HTML is extremely important. 'nav' and 'main' make it easier to jump around the page, and accurately land on buttons
        and places to proceed around the page.
        <br><br>
        There are also other web standards in place that support Universal Design. ARIA is an initiative that adds semtantic meanings to more complex UI components when HTML alone can't describe them. ARIA can be used for labeling
        interactive elements, describing relationships between elements or marking roles in modals. There is also WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) which is the gold standard for digital accessibility, which outlines testable success
        criteria for making content understandable.
